# Cloud Module Application

This is an web application written in Python. It does things and we'd like help deploying it.

## Requirements and how to run

* Python 3.8 or higher is required to run the application
* All requirements are specified in the requirements.txt file
  * You can install the requirements via pip (which comes with python): `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  * the use of Virtualenv is strongly suggested for local development to avoid installing packages globally
* The application can be run via the `flask run` command
